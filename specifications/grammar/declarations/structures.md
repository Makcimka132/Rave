# Structures

Structures are a full-fledged type that has a designation like class in C++.

A structure can have a constructor, a destructor, methods, and operator overloading.

List of possible parameters:
- packed - the structure is not aligned for optimization.
- data: "name" - set a variable with values stored for foreach.
- length: "name" - set a variable with count of values stored for foreach.

Example:

```d
struct A {
    int a;
    int b;
    
    // Constructor
    A this(int f, int s) {
        /*
        Control over memory allocation is entirely in the hands of the author of the structure.
        In our case, memory is allocated on the stack.
        */
        A this;
        this.a = f;
        this.b = s;
    } => this; // We have to return the value from the constructor, as in all other functions.
    
    // Destructor
    void ~this {
        /*
        The destructor must be of type void and have no arguments. This won't be an error, but the compiler will automatically remove all arguments if there are any.

        If there is no destructor in the function, it is generated automatically.
        */

        // ...
    }

    void printAll {
        std::println(this.a, this.b);
    }

    void operator=(A* pointer, int[2] values) {
        /*
        Overloading of the '=' operator. The first argument must have a pointer type to this structure (or a pointer type to a pointer if the structure is in heap).
        */

        pointer.a = values[0];
        pointer.b = values[1];
    }

    bool operator in(A* pointer, int rnd) => rnd in [pointer.a, pointer.b];
}

(packed, data: "one", length: "two") struct B {
    int* one;
    int two;
}

struct C {
    int one;
    int two;
    (noCopy) int three;
}

struct D : C {
    // is copying elements and all methods from one structure to another.
    // to not copy some method or variable, you can use noCopy flag
}
```
